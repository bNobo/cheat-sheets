# Teams cheat sheet

## Set an animated background

1. Select a GIF file you would like to use as animated background. Let's say it is named `animated_backgroud.gif`
2. Go to `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Teams\Backgrounds\Uploads` folder.
3. Copy `animated_backgroud.gif` into the folder and rename it to `animated_backgroud.jpg`
4. Create a thumbnail jpg image in the same folder and name it `animated_backgroud_thumb.jpg`
