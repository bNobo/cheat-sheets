# Teams cheat sheet

## Set an animated background

1. Select a GIF file you would like to use as animated background. Let's say it is named `animated_background.gif`
2. Go to `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Teams\Backgrounds\Uploads` folder.
3. Copy `animated_background.gif` into that folder and rename it to `animated_background.jpg`
4. Create a thumbnail jpg image in the same folder and name it `animated_background_thumb.jpg`

> Tip : create a copy of source GIF and convert it to jpg, then reduce image size to get a thumbnail.
